I usually have too many projects going at once, this will be a small subset of ones that are in a state I don't hate to show off.

* [Happybara](https://happybara.io) Slack apps with all the functionality you expect from the web
* *Thyme* a Ballerina lang module to humanize working with the `stdlib` time module.
* Yugioh card scanner & price checker, both a CLI tool and a website
* *Deals on Tap* collecting bar specials on the UW-Madison campus for my friends to use
