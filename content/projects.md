I usually have too many projects going at once, this will be a small subset of ones that are in a state I don't hate to show off.

* [Facade Project Podcast](https://facadeproject.com/) A podcast with a couple friends to explore new things.
* [Free on Your Birthday](https://freeonyourbirthday.co) I missed out on getting free food on my birthday, so I started collecting all the ones I could find into an Airtable database. A No-code project.
* Writing - I started writing on this blog and [Medium](https://maybekevinquinn.medium.com/). Whether or not anyone reads it, it has been incredibly helpful to process thoughts instead of letting them endlessly bounce within my skull.
* [Happybara](https://happybara.io) Slack apps with all the functionality you expect from the web.
* [_Thyme_](https://central.ballerina.io/i_dont_remember/thyme)a [Ballerina lang](https://ballerina.io/ "Ballerina Lang site") module to humanize working with the `stdlib` time module.
* [_Equation Finder_](https://equation-finder.netlify.app/) a tool to help you understand what equations you have available base on given quantities. For solving problems in Physics, Math, Chemistry, and more.
* Yugioh card scanner & price checker, both a CLI tool and a [website](https://yugiohprices.netlify.app/ "Yu-Gi-Oh Card Prices")
* [_Deals on Tap_](https://dealsontap.netlify.app/ "Deals on Tap: bar specials at UW-Madison") collecting bar specials on the UW-Madison campus for my friends to use.
