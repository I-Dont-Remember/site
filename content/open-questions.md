These are questions and ideas I'm curious about, but don't have much in the way of answers for. I hope to keep this as a living document, adding relevant information as I find it.

## Suburban cultural inefficiencies

The U.S. is full of places where you have row after row of houses, each with 1-2 cars, a lawn mower, snow blower, washer, dryer, a garage of tools, and more. Everybody has to have their own, but do we really? I get with the current set up it's not feasible to share everything, but it seems so excessive and just wasting so much collective time & money.

* Tool Libraries are a fascinating concept
* Seen several startups which let you get paid to loan out your items

## Smart people doing pointless work

There are so many incredibly talented humans who go off to school, get top quality educations, then spend their lives shuffling numbers back and forth in the stock market. All that potential just dissapears into the churn of business. It's not their fault, they are following the incentive which helps them and their family, can't fault that. Everyone knows teaching, social work, etc. is terribly paid and it's a common joke, but nothing ever changes around it? How can the vast amount of human potential lost in the rat race get converted into valuable effort focused against the many, many issues that still exist.

## Life stagnation vs incredible transformations

It blows my mind that one one hand, you can have pretty much the same life for decades if you don't have any inclination to change yourself and have found a comfortable job/family/etc. that doesn't force change, and on the other, you can have people who change careers to wildly different fields in just 6 months or become fluent in a language in 3. We have these preconceived notions of things taking a very long time, but there are loads of examples of humans moving super fast.

## Unspoken rules we live by, the Status-Quo

Some people seem to have an easier time breaking the mold and doing whatever comes to their mind. We look down on Flat Earthers, Big Foot Hunters, etc. but maybe there is something we can learn from them, whether or not you believe what they say. It's difficult to go against common convention.

## Reframing failure in adults after decades of focus on tests not learning

There are millions of people like me, who grew up in a school system that taught you to shy away from failure and actually learning came second. It destroys your curiosity, your creativity, and you become a machine that's only goal is to do as good as possible on arbitrary test questions that only somewhat show your knowledge.

There's lots of people working to make teaching better, though somewhat slow about it. How do we retroactively rewire all these 20-50 year old adults to look at failure in a different light, and be willing to try new things?
