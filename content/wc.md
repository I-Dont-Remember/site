I struggle with over-thinking, perfectionism, and never shipping. To that end I've been setting goals for myself geared towards taking action.

Goal is to reach 1 million words written on the world wide web. For now I approximate this with just what appears on this site, as I'd rather undercount a little and write extra than have random internet comments give me a false sense of progress.

## Milestones for fun

- Me: as of Jan 2025, `72,300` words.
- ....
- The **"Redwall"** series seem to vary between `90,500` - `126,200` words.
- **"The Hobbit"** - `95,356` words.
- **"Lord of the Rings"**, the three main books: `481,103` words.
