I struggle with over-thinking, perfectionism, and never shipping. To that end I've been setting goals for myself geared towards taking action.

Goal is to reach 1 million words written on the world wide web. For now I approximate this with just what appears on this site, as I'd rather undercount a little and write extra than have random internet comments give me a false sense of progress.

Partially inspired by:

- [Patio11's WC page](https://www.kalzumeus.com/wc/)
- [Author's public word count progress towards next book](https://flynnblair.com/).
