Inspired by [Trevor Mckendrick's yearly themes](https://www.trevormckendrick.com/essays/why-i-create-yearly-themes) idea, I wanted to create my own, seems like a valid experiment to hopefully have a fantastic year. Instead of doing based on calendar year, I plan to go based off my age since I just turned over a new year and want to get started right away. No waiting for January 1st! So what will be my theme, what is my goal for 26?

## Action 26

My theme is very similar to [Trevor's Build 2021](https://www.trevormckendrick.com/essays/build-2021-the-annual-theme-manifesto), it's Action 26. I want to spend the year taking action vs reading, get out there and put tangible output into the world instead of just reading about it. I want to be dangerously action oriented, assume action over research any day. [I need to grab a shitty rod and start fishing](https://www.dickiebush.com/articles/fishing). I end up waiting for permission to do things, whether that's through a person, or the permission from myself to know enough about something to get started, aka spend way too many hours researching the best way to start instead of actually trying anything. I'd like to expand this with more quotes and stories like Trevor's theme does, to use it as a reminder whenever I need a refresher on what I want out of the year, but for now this will have to do. Put this imperfect article out into the world, and fix it later if it matters.
