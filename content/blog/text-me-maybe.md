Once I've finished the couple projects I'm currently working on, I'll be using this post to document my process in completing sms2sheets, and then also as a link to the later posts when I use that knowledge to hopefully convert the Gymnastics Club carpool sign-up (currently a Google Sheet) to also have easy to use SMS and web interfaces to sign-up for practices.
