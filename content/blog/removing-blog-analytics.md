I'm turning off traffic analytics for my personal blog. It's a journey back to the heart of writing, finding solace in the quiet, and rekindling the pleasure of writing without the pressure of numbers.

## Why did i add them?

I originally added [privacy-first analytics](https://plausible.io) to my personal blog with the intention to add extra motivation to my growing writing habit. In my head, being able to see which articles were most popular would be a positive.

To be completely honest, I also had a fantasy of seeing "Number Go Up" and eventually becoming like the great engineer writers I love reading, like [Gergely](https://www.pragmaticengineer.com/), [patio11](https://www.kalzumeus.com/about/), [ben kuhn](https://www.benkuhn.net/abyss/), etc.

I'm also a sucker for easily trackable metrics, despite often being an inadequate reflection of what I'm aiming for.

## State of my blog traffic & sources

I was starting to get a decent amount of traffic - nothing to write home about, but 500-1,000 people a week reading the words I mushed together. Most of my sites are ~10 views a week, so it felt like a lot to me!

 Most of my traffic—like 99% of it—was coming from Google & going to the same five articles. They were the ones I wrote to test out what I'd learned about SEO. The remaining 1% of traffic was thinly spread across my other 80+ posts.

It took a while to realize, but eventually I noticed my publishing frequency had dropped to almost nothing. The last 6-12 months I've barely published, and it's not because my life situation changed drastically. When I took time to reflect on why, my gut pointed me towards analytics as a contributing factor.

## Why analytics was negative

I turned analytics off a couple weeks ago to experiment & ["shake the snow globe"](https://blog.nateliason.com/p/you-have-no-idea-how-much-better). So far, I haven't felt like anything is missing from life, and I'm starting to feel excited about writing again. If I had to pin down why I think analytics was negative for me:

- The venn diagram of articles I get excited to write about & the ones which get traffic has a very small overlap.
- It's demotivating to see articles i worked hard on get 0 views week after week, while a low-effort SEO experiment keeps growing.
- In some ways I felt like focusing on a flawed, but easily trackable metric led me to losing the intrinsic value of the creative process that had me start a blog in the first place.

> _**Blog Distribution**_
> 
> _I have to take some responsibility for the lack of diversity in traffic sources, since I do a horrible job of marketing/distributing my articles. Of course SEO will be the only source of traffic if I don't put myself out there._

## Hello silence my old friend

So for now - I'm leaving analytics off.

I envision my [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) as Schrödinger's blog—an unobserved realm where traffic is both abundant and non-existent. By refraining from peeking into the proverbial box, I am freeing myself to write authentically and explore diverse topics without the looming influence of metrics. I embrace the idea that I am both the writer and sole reader, finding joy in the uninhibited expression of my thoughts and ideas.
