After stumbling upon [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/ "Ballerina") and reading through their landing page of reasons why to try it, I was hooked. All of their reasons resonated with my thoughts on software, so I figured I should dedicate some time to give it thorough run-through.

Usually when learning a new language I flounder around through intro tutorials meant for people interested in learning to code from scratch. I've spent enough time banging my head against keyboards to have general concepts like variables decently under my belt, so these often just lead to frustration and not really learning anything new. This time, I have a new approach. I plan to do very cursory reading of their existing doumentation to get some of the key concepts into my head, then dive into writing a clone of a popular library from another language. A wide range of topics can be covered this way that "hello, world" programs don't often stray into, things like packaging, documentation, and unit testing your code. This is especially important for a new language to get a feel for the developer experience. Does the language punish you for the insolence of trying to write it? (not naming names here). Does it make writing high-quality, well-documented software the path of least resistance? This is at least partially the claim from Ballerina, so let's see how well it stands up to scrutiny by writing a clone of [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv "dotenv")!
