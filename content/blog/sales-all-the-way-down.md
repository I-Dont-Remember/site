As an engineer, I always thought sales was this distant land of people with slicked-back hair, and that I'd never have to concern myself with it - but I've misled myself. **It's sales all the way down**.

## Engineering canâ€™t be sales!!

- Getting funding for a startup is selling your **idea** and **yourself** to VCs, or Kickstarters, or whoever will give you the money to work on it.
- Hiring is selling the **idea** + the quality of your company to convince people to join.
- Marketing is sales.
- Engineering is just delayed sales, since everything you do should be driving business value - engineering creates the features which are the sales pitch.
- Promotions within a company are selling **yourself**.
- Getting people internally to work on your idea is, you guessed it, selling your **idea**.

## Ok... now what?

Now lambaste me and tell me all the ways I'm wrong so I can sleep peacefully at night.
