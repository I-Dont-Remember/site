Coding is a tool, but there is so much depth within it it often feels like an art form. There are so many different ways to approach the same problem with different frameworks, languages, and architectures. The end product could be the same but look totally different under the hood. This is the underlying reason coding is so dangerous for developers. It is incredibly easy to lose sight of the original goal: solving a problem.   
   
 It's very easy to dive in to a project deciding that you should build it from scratch because you're a developer, you can code! You have the magic power to bring amazing things into being with just a keyboard! So you start creating, troubleshooting bugs you didn't know would pop up because libraries aren't working exactly as you imagined, then some of the features you pictured in your head turn out to be more complicated once you get to trying to write them. Little did you know it could be solved in a few minutes with a spreadsheet and a Google form. It's an amazing feeling to see something you've worked on come to life, but it can blind us to the simple solutions that can be had with a little more patience.  
   
 Alright, so you've searched around and mulled it over, it actually does make sense to build something out to solve your problem. Awesome, you've been meaning to try out that fancy new time-series database you saw on ProductHunt!  
 Chances are though, you won't be the only person to have to work with this. Will the next person have the experience & knowledge to maintain niche tools? Does it put your company in a position where their [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor "Wiki: Bus Factor") is just you?   
   
 Fine, we decided it made more sense to use technologies that are more stable and commonplace, even if they aren't as exciting. Well, this should probably incorporate some machine-learning background jobs to give us insights on the best path forward right? Maybe a little blockchain under the hood? It also needs to be multi-region & scalable to the nth degree to make sure we can handle the millions of users waiting around the corner for this. If it's not fully resilient, they won't even want to use it! Developers love adding features and improving software, especially the ones who care about the craft. Like artists, they will never be satisfied with their work and can always find something to tweak. At some point, though, energy is better spent elsewhere. It's easy to forget to ask "Are these features actually what people need/asked for?".  
   
 The danger in these situations is when coding becomes a 'feel-productive' task while not moving you closer to a solution. This happens because of the disconnect between the actions taken that let us check off boxes (writing a new feature, deploying the service, etc.) with the actual outcome that we are searching for. It feels great to see progress, but if that path leads to nowhere you end up just fooling yourself.  
   
 The possibilities available when you know how to code are staggering. It's easy to become lost in the void of possibilities, losing your tether to your original goal. Next time you're looking over a project ask yourself:

* Does it need code?
* What is the Simple Lovable Complete ([SLC](https://blog.asmartbear.com/slc.html) "Simple Lovable Complete")) version of the solution?
* What tech stack makes the most sense for the context of the project, rather than what is shiny and interesting?
*  Am I actually making progress toward this goal or do I just feel productive? (Ask this one regularly)
