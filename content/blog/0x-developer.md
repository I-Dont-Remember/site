The trope of the 10x Developer has been written about ad nauseum, but there's another type you are more likely to meet in your career - the 0x Developer.

What makes a 0x Developer? These are the folks who:

- Ask questions they could’ve answered with a single search
- Burn time and attention from teammates teaching them, but never learning
- Managed to become professionally paid developers without having basic computer literacy -- like knowing how to copy & paste a command into a terminal.

Honestly 0x is a bit generous, because sometimes these devs eat up so much energy from the rest of the team they're a negative addition, but I think 0x rolls off the tongue better than negative-x Developer[^1].

This isn’t about skill. Everyone starts somewhere. Mistakes from inexperience are fine, even encouraged, because humans usually need to burn their hand to learn a lesson, no matter how many times you say the stove is hot. But there’s a difference between not knowing yet, and not bothering to figure it out.

Don't be a 0x Dev.

[^1]:: How do I know I'm not a 0x Dev? I'm no Kent Dodds, but I occasionally slap enough of the right code & actions together to have numerous people tell me I'm a useful teammate. Or maybe I'm a giant hypocrite.
