I was recently walking past Equinox, the fancy $250/mo gym, and was thinking about at what level of income you'd have to be at for that to be a no-brainer, "Starbucks coffee"-level, decision. As a somewhat regular person _(or so I'd like to think)_ the idea of paying for such an expensive gym when there's one down the road charging $40/mo seems insane - but if you make a metric butt load of money, it's not even worth your energy to worry about. How much does that Super Rich person make, and what does it tell us about money being relative to our purchasing power?

## Setting definitions

Let's establish a baseline that a new college-grad, or maybe tradesperson like a plumber, making $65k/year considers an individual Starbucks drink to have a trivial effect on their finances.

I'm considering **Trivial** to be: even if you do it 10 times a month, it has a low impact on your budget. 

With this definition, it sets our purchase threshold at **0.1%** of monthly income - 10x would be only 1%. If we set our threshold to 1% though, 10x is **10%**! 10% is a big chunk of rent/groceries/etc, so that's a no-no.

## When Equinox == Starbucks
With our definition of trivial purchase set, how does our Starbucks-wielding friend fare?

- Starbucks coffee ~ $5
- $65k => $5400/mo
- 5/5400 = 0.0925%

That's less than our threshold of 0.1%! If we follow that same ratio, what would their Super Rich Friend need to make for the fancy gym membership to be a no-brainer like a coffee?

- 0.0925% = $250 / X (monthly income)
- X = $270k/mo, or $3.2 million/yr!

## Find your trivial purchase price

Now that we see how it works under the hood, this chart maps out a ratio of 0.1% of monthly income vs a yearly salary to understand how it scales up and down.
