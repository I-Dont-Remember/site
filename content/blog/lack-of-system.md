The lack of a system is still a system.

> ME: *"What do you MEAN you don't have a To-Do list app?!"*

I have spent way too many hours reading productivity books, organizing, and trying to optimize the systems that run my life.  I have my calendar, To-Do list app, reminders, my "Second Brain" in Obsidian & Notion, SOPs, and more. I'm stuck in my productivity/systems bubble, sometimes I forget the vast majority of people I know manage to live productive & successful lives with nothing but a calendar, if even that.

The lack of a system is still a system, in the same way that the lack of a decision is a form of decision. You chose to delay making a choice. It's a choice to not expend energy making a system, and let one form organically out of chaos.

## In defense of not having a system

> *"Look at all these idiots without systems, their lives are so inefficient"*

...is what I'd like to tell myself to make the many hours invested into my personal systems worthwhile. Unfortunately to not be an F-tier human, I have to try to keep my ego in check.

I have to remind myself that despite not having my "superior" systems in their lives, none of my primitive, system-less friends ever wasted an ENTIRE day alone in a room migrating hundreds of Post-It notes to a digital list. I had my desk^__*__ buried in a layer of the damn things, and I painstakingly digitized every. single. one. I deleted the whole thing a couple months later when I realized it was just a stressful heap. Surprisingly, my life didn't change at all once they were gone.

Sometimes a lack of system, can BE the system.

- ^__*__: technically it was the keyboard drawer of my desk, but that didn't sound nice. It's my blog, deal with it.
