I had a vague understanding that different states had different levels of taxes _(wow Florida with that no-income tax woot woot!)_, but never went deeper. The rise of remote work in the last couple years brought this question into sharper focus:

**Given a remote worker allowed to live in any state, with salary not adjusted, how does their tax burden vary?**

## The data

I found a [handy online calculator](https://www.talent.com/tax-calculator?salary=50000&from=year&region=Illinois) for the base data, ran it for a variety of salaries, then did some simple calcs on the aggregate across states & salary buckets.

Buckets I chose:

- $50k, $75k, $100k, $125k - _(then for giggles & Silicon Valley folks)_ - $150k, $200k, $250k, $300k.

> [‚ÑπÔ∏è] _If you want to dive deeper into the data for your exact salary, I highly recommend checking out that calculator, because they also provide extra information, like how much a marginal salary increase will net you. Example: `For instance, an increase of $100 in your salary will be taxed $25.15, hence, your net pay will only increase by $74.85.`[src](https://www.talent.com/tax-calculator?salary=50000&from=year&region=Illinois)._


## Best & worst states, per salary bucket

This table goes through and compares the best & worst amounts of take-home pay for each of the salary buckets. My personal takeaways:

- I thought the difference between best & worst would be higher, but it's fairly consistent around **8%** of your base salary. Guess that's the Federal taxes keeping things level.
- If I made `$75k` base salary in Hawaii and then moved to Florida, I'd have an extra `$5,659.00` to spend on plastic trinkets from Amazon. **Wild!**
- If you aren't moving highest taxes to lowest, but highest to mid tier, that number drops to median of `$3,335.00`. A couple grand ain't nothing, but that's in best case scenario of highest taxes to average - which won't be a lot of people. I haven't done the calculations for averaging the difference between every combination of states, but it would likely be `$2-4k`.
  - I had originally hypothesized it would be a no-brainer to move for a free & sizable _"bonus"_ to your salary. Looks like it's not so cut-and-dry, especially considering moving can be an expensive endeavor on it's own.

## Range of rankings, per state

I was then curious about how states vary in ranking as income increases. My personal takeaways:

- Vermont (`28`), New Jersey (`25`), and California (`22`) had the largest change in ranking across the 8 salary buckets. Seems like those are states that are pretty decent to be in at _"common"_ salary bands, but if you're crazy rich the taxes are giving you a hard time.
- The top 10 states didn't budge at all - this makes sense as [8 of them don't have state income tax, and NH doesn't tax earned wages](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0210/7-states-with-no-income-tax.aspx). North Dakota holds it spot by having it at [<3% even if you make $500k/year](https://www.tax-rates.org/north_dakota/income-tax).
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è _It was mentioned to me that Washington has some FMLA Tax that doesn't technically count as state tax, but which should end up demoting it on this list. I couldn't find any specific % numbers to include, but if you have more info I'd appreciate if you reached out!_
- Median change was `5` places - which to me feels like a fairly consistent set of rankings. I have no stats background, so just nod along if that's wildly innacurate üòÖ.
