It's taken me a long time to give myself permission to write. For years, I was adamantly opposed to writing. I thought I could never be a writer, and never would have a desire to try. Part of my frustration with writing was the fear of failure. Writing isn't like math, there is no simple evaluation of right and wrong everyone agrees on. The subjective nature of it scared me. How do you become better at something that is based on the interpretation of each reader? I want to be responsible for my own successes or failures, but with writing control of the outcome leaves my hands.

There was also the stream of self-doubt so many face that crushes new ideas before you can ever get them out. I'm not creative enough, I'm not an expert in anything, so what would I say?

"Who would ever listen to a guy that runs into stationary objects on the regular?"

What helped me make the switch was realizing that **it's not up to you**. It's not up to you to decide what people want to read or what information they may find helpful. As inherently selfish humans, we often struggle to remember there are lenses other than our own. It's hard to stay cognizant of the fact there might be people who are striving to get where you're standing, and you have knowledge that could help. Your voice may be the one in a sea of options that makes a topic click for people. You may have a different angle on a story than any current work. **You will never know until you've published**.

I gave myself permission to write, and you can do the same. Don't self-sabotage your ideas before they ever see the light of day. It will be scary to have your thoughts roaming wild in the world, and everything won't be sunshine and butterflies.

Your piece may be bad.

The topic may be over done.

It may get ignored.

But for the chance your words resonate with someone, write.
