I'm no data scientist, but inspired by Spotify Wrapped (and even more so by [Jimmy John's Wrapped](https://twitter.com/BBarberie/status/1608476950108209158)) - let's explore what a Venmo Wrapped might look like! Unfortunately, this won't be as exciting as when Venmo left a public API open for the whole world's transactions - [https://publicbydefault.fyi/](https://publicbydefault.fyi/).

## My Venmo Wrapped 2022

To give you a preview of what sort of info you might find in your own Venmo Wrapped, here's mine for 2022 (omitting any sensitive details like specific people or amounts):

![](/uploads/venmo-wrapped-2022.jpg)

* Oldest incomplete request is 1,332 days (May 10, 2019)
* 45 people interacted with
* 2 businesses
* 49/64 of my requests went to one person
* 20% of notes I received had >1 emoji
* 25% of notes I received were a joke of some sort (e.g. `no u`, `ðŸ’©`)
* I sent the majority of my requests on Sun & Mon (63%)

If this piqued your interest at all, read on to make your own! I'll add a list farther down of other interesting stats people have suggested.

## How to make your own Venmo Wrapped

Making your own Wrapped only takes a couple of steps: gathering the CSV file of transactions from the Venmo website, copying them into either the Google Sheet template I made (or one of your own), then just update your Venmo name in the specified Sheet cell. A bunch of default stats will populate, then the sky is the limit for digging through your own data!

### Gather

## Potentially interesting data points

After showing a few friends, I started getting feedback with ideas - I haven't explored them, but maybe one of the curious citizens of the internet will find them interesting:

 - Time of day trends, similar to Spotify's _"Your morning aesthetic was X_"
  - What time of day am I most likely to pay?
- day/week/month of the year you were most active
- Most common words/emojis in the notes
- Top 3 "givers" vs "moochers" - basically people that give you money, and people that take your money
* Who paid the slowest/fastest? \*_(I don't believe this is possible with existing CSV data provided by Venmo)_
- < Your great idea here >...
