As a creator, it’s so easy to get tunnel vision — focusing on the vast distance between the current version and the perfect state in your head.  Never mind that “perfect” is a constantly shifting and impossible target.  Recently, though, [a comment on that orange news site](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30589953#2330589953) [1] in response to *“How did you overcome perfectionism?”* helped begin shifting my mindset.  The idea boils down to:

> Only **YOU** can see the perfect vision in your imagination and where the current version falls short. From an outside perspective, all they see is you going from 0 → thing. If it’s useful, then great! No one cares what it might have been besides you.
>

It felt like the sun peeking through the clouds 🌤️. Duh, of course no one can see what’s in your head! As long as what you’ve created is at a milestone, it’s finished in other people’s eyes. Anything past that is a bonus. AS the creator, though, you see it as missing your expected pieces and falling short of it’s potential. One idea won’t change a lifetime of perfectionism inertia on it’s own, but trying to see imagined ideas for a project as bonuses, rather than necessary elements, is a first step. Best of luck for those on similar journeys, and get shipping 🚢.
