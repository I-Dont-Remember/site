These are the questions I wish I would have been asked before wasting hour after hour on projects which never launched ❌🚀 or were a Solution Looking for a Problem. Use them to cut the crap and see your project from an observer’s perspective.

_Are you building a product or solving a problem?_
{{< /notion-callout >}}

## Goals

- Get an experiment shipped out the door ASAP
- Understand your assumptions
- Find real validation for your idea
- Discover quickly if you are building something no one wants  → are you building a *Solution Looking for a Problem*?

> [Justin Jackson on Twitter: "We think we should be rewarded for the effort, resources, and time we invest in a project.
But markets don't work that way.
With startups, the amount of reward you get (revenue) is based on demand: "How strongly do people want what you're selling?""](https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/1465777669476274181)

## Common Problems

![Why People Haven't launched yet Tweet @levelsio](/uploads/why-people-havent-launched-yet-pieter-levels.jpg "source: https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1466673403318784001?s=20" )

- Asking awful questions that don't validate their assumptions - asking hypothetical questions to people who aren't the target audience. Double bad. Read about the [Mom Test](http://momtestbook.com/).
- Solution looking for a problem.
- Solution for a market that isn’t willing or doesn’t care enough to pay for a solution.
- Focusing on growth hacks on a product no one wants.
- Struggle making decisions - there's a million to be made about every detail, like picking a name - but you only need to get the big ones right and the small ones won't matter.
- Positioning is crappy, or missing.
- Fear blocking launching - whether you recognize it or not.
- Using excuses to prevent themselves from seeing hard truths.
- Having an idea with validation, but waffling on the perfect way to build and other technicalities.

## Questions

### Basic

- What are you building, and why are you excited about this?
- Describe your product in less than 2 sentences, it should fit on a post it note and **_be OBVIOUS_**.
    
    > - **Delete multiple tweets with one click.**
    > - **Short links, big results - A URL shortener built with powerful tools to help you grow and protect your brand.**
    > 
- Have you launched yet?
- How many customers do you have?
- How much revenue have you pulled in? What's the median price a customer pays you? (don't let outliers fool you)

### Understanding the problem space

- What is the problem you are solving?
- Why is this a problem people care about?
- who's your target customer? What do they act like, what do they do?
- What assumptions are you making? How might you validate them to help guide your direction?
- What actions have you taken to validate that people want this? How many potential customers have you talked to?

### Simplifying what you build

> Also many people THINK they launched many MVP prototypes but instead they launched many unusable dysfunctional messy web apps/sites
> 
> An MVP means Minimum Viable Product it doesn't mean Dysfunctional POS
> 
> It has to be VERY usable but simple and do 1 thing great
> - Pieter Levels

- What is the 1 core feature that people are buying this for, the one that if it was missing, no other feature would matter? e.g. Bitly - short url redirects. If you're building things and don't have that nailed, stop.
- Could you describe your first version as [**Simple, Lovable, and Complete**](https://blog.asmartbear.com/slc.html)? Doesn’t matter if it isn’t perfect yet.
    - Another great visualization for **Earliest Testable/Usable/Lovable -** [Making Sense of MVP](https://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp)

- What does the ideal version of this in your head look like? What are the 2 most important features you imagined? I’m assuming it’s not user accounts or dark mode 😉.
- If you could snap your fingers and have your perfect version of the software finished today, what are your next steps for 1 month - 3 months - 6 months?
- What assumptions are you making as a part of this? Can we make those less vague? Have you answered any of them yet?

### Shipping & Distribution

- What % of your time is spent on activities that put you in front of new faces (content marketing, launches, etc.)? Why is it not higher?
- Have you put this in front of a large number of people?
    - If you get no 👀 eyes on it, of course you won’t have any sales. Even a great product won’t sell if no one sees it.
- Where does your target audience hang out, and why have you not talked to them?
- What is stopping you from shipping? If you have reasons why you’re not, can you find alternative routes around them?
- How might you be committing Productive Procrastination?
