    > *How do you build SaaS from scratch?
    It's easy. Go to Gumroad, find something that sells well and turn it into SaaS*
    > 
- Bring class to the masses
    
    [Amjad Masad ‚†ï on Twitter: "A good way to generate technology¬†¬†ideas is to look at what rich people have that normal people don‚Äôt. For example in the past only the rich had access to personal assistants (Siri), chefs (DoorDash), and drivers (Uber)."](https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1431694805977878535?s=20)
    
- Rip, Pivot, and Jam
    
    > *Studying what works for other indie hackers is one of the best ways to find realistic, profitable business ideas.¬†¬†Many indie hackers share exactly how they did it which makes it much easier to replicate their success.¬†¬†The idea is not to clone successful products (that probably won't work anyway) but to "rip, pivot, and jam".¬†¬†Rip: Study a successful business and copy their business model.¬†¬†Pivot: Apply the business model to another industry or vertical.¬†¬†Jam: Hustle to get customers.¬†¬†Or as Bruce Lee puts it: "Absorb what is useful, reject what is useless, add what is essentially your own."*
    > 
- Chrome Extensions
    
    > *Chrome extensions are criminally underrated. Simple to build, sticky for users, and can provide a ton of value by sitting on top of 5+ hours a day of internet browsing. Pretty cool to see some of these products that started as chrome extensions become $1B+ businesses. More will come. -Someone on Twitter*
    > 
    
    > *The billion dollar Google Chrome extension club:*
    > 
    > - *Loom*
    > - *Honey*
    > - *Grammarly*
    > 
    > *These companies started as Chrome Extensions and created billions of value*

- 'The latest startup theme du jour is ‚Äúhelping creators make money‚Äù but I am and always will be bullish on the theme ‚Äúmake a developer‚Äôs life easier‚Äù.'
- Shopify apps/Wordpress plugins - is there one that is solving a heavily sought after problem, but only doing well because it‚Äôs the least-bad option? Is there room for a niche service business or SaaS off of it?
