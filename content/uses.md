Overall philosophy with my items is to buy quality where it matters, but we often over complicate and draw to the shiny. Remember, expensive or new **does not** mean better quality by default.

## Physical

- 🖥🖱**Desktop**
  - Windows -> Dell Inspiron with i5-4590 I got for $150 many years ago. Still runs like a champ. If you want a workhorse for cheap, search 'Inspiron' on Ebay and get yourself a deal.
- ⌨ **keyboard** - 8+ year old from a Goodwill.
- 💻 **Laptop**
  - Windows Samsung galaxy book, switched from a Linux machine when I started spending more time writing and less time messing around with Linux utilities.
- 💺**Free office chair**
  - If you hang out near nice apartments, people throw out nice stuff 😊.
- 🧍‍♂️📦 **Standing desk, electric**
  - _"Why didn't you just buy a tall desk?"_ I splurged a bit on this, I have a history of being a cheap-ass and trying to invest in myself where it matters.

## Software I love using

- **[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com)**
  - Use it whenever possible, faster than using paper for getting ideas from my 🧠 into visual medium.
- **Notion** - replaced Google Docs
- **[Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md)** - building a 2nd brain in Obsidian because the first one was slacking.
- **[Tick Tick](https://ticktick.com)** - I use it as the initial dumping ground for everything because it "just works" on mobile, I never have issues. Plenty of to-do apps can do the same, but this is where I landed.
- **[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com)** - Open source password management, works excellent and supporting a small team.
- **Duolingo** - Debates on how well it teaches aside, it's such a fun tool to use and encourages coming back better than many video games I've played.
