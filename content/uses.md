## Physical

- Desktop
  - Windows -> Dell Inspiron with i5-4590 I got for $150 many years ago. Still runs like a champ. If you want a workhorse for cheap, search 'Inspiron' on Ebay and get yourself a deal.
- Laptop
  - Windows Samsung galaxy book, switched from a Linux machine when I started spending more time writing and less time messing around with Linux utilities.

## Software I love using

- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com)
  - Use it whenever possible, faster than using paper for getting ideas from my ðŸ§  into visual medium.
- Notion - replaced Google Docs
- [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) - building a 2nd brain in Obsidian because the first one was slacking.
