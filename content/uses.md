Overall philosophy with my items is to buy quality where it matters, but we often over complicate and draw to the shiny. Remember, expensive or new **does not** mean better quality by default.

## Software I love using

- **[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com)**
  - Use it whenever possible, faster than using paper for getting ideas from my 🧠 into visual medium.
- **[Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md)** - building a 2nd brain in Obsidian because the first one was slacking.
- **[Tick Tick](https://ticktick.com)** - I use it as the initial dumping ground for everything because it "just works" on mobile, I never have issues. Plenty of to-do apps can do the same, but this is where I landed.
- **[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com)** - Open source password management, works excellent and supporting a small team.
- **VSCode** - like everyone else & their mother.
- **Notion** - replaced Google Docs with a subset of people I interact with, though it's hard to beat the convenience of sharing Google Sheets/docs since it feels like EVERYONE has a Google account :(.

## Physical

- 🖥🖱**Desktop**
  - Windows -> Dell Inspiron with i5-4590 I got for $150 many years ago. Still runs like a champ. If you want a workhorse for cheap, search 'Inspiron' on Ebay and get yourself a deal.
- ⌨ **keyboard** - 8+ year old from a Goodwill.
- 💻 **Laptop**
  - Windows Samsung galaxy book, switched from a Linux machine when I started spending more time writing and less time messing around with Linux utilities.
- 💺**Free office chair**
  - If you hang out near nice apartments, people throw out nice stuff 😊.
- 🧍‍♂️📦 **Standing desk, electric**
  - _"Why didn't you just buy a tall desk?"_ I splurged a bit on this, I have a history of being a cheap-ass and trying to invest in myself where it matters.
