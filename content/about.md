Software engineer by day at Large Corp üèõ, and [all sorts of stuff by night - notary, reluctant runner, ordained, ....](#-professional-dabbler) since I can‚Äôt sit still. I‚Äôve attempted to build a number of different SaaS products before realizing creating content is just as, if not more, fun than writing code you have to maintain ü§ì. I‚Äôve worn a lot of hats, from founder, developer, writer, podcaster, open source contributor, and more. Investigating a growing interest in writing, Developer & User Experience, No-code, entrepreneurship, and cyber security.

If you'd like to reach out for whatever reason, easiest place to reach me is through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maybekq) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/quinnkevinp).

If you are curious what it's like to work with me, I have been described as:

- _having Golden Retriever energy_
- [_Phil Dunphy approach to life_](https://modernfamily.fandom.com/wiki/Phil_Dunphy)
- [Playing Sean Paul's _"Get Busy"_ on a recorder?](/recorder-escapades/)

Unfortunately no one has used _"impossibly handsome"_ or _"The Rock"_ as their descriptors, but someday....

## How I got into writing code

Ended up studying Computer Engineering in my first year of university, but the classes I started with didn't catch my attention, and I assumed it wasn't for me. Amidst cramming for exams, I attempted to write a small Python script to spam [a certain well-known music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) in new browser tabs on my friends computer. I had no idea how to distribute my mildly-malicious program (thereby only spamming myself), but the seed was planted üå±. What my courses were missing that this ~10 line script had was the capability -- unlike my classes building Java apps in the IDE CLI I didn't understand, here I was actually controlling the computer! Thus, the spark grew into into my modern-day self of Jira tickets and [**LGTM**](https://justtechdebt.com/articles/dev-already-abandoned-new-years-resolution-to-actually-read-prs/).

## What I do

### üßë‚Äçüíª [Product-minded](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer/) Backend Software Engineer/ [Developer Generalist](https://granot.dev/developer-generalists/)

- If you‚Äôre looking for a code monkey to optimize clicks, we‚Äôll both be disappointed üôà.
- Know enough to be dangerous across the stack, from [infra with Ansible](https://github.com/I-Dont-Remember/AnsibleLaptop) to APIs in Python to SPAs like React, but most effective working with non-GUI projects ‚Äî CLIs, APIs, backend systems. Frontend just ain't my jam long-term.
  - _Slack bots are the most fun to work with, because you can do "front-end" UX work without having to deal with CSS - their [Block Kit framework](https://api.slack.com/block-kit) just takes JSON and then renders things all pretty for you._
- I focus on building products with value, rather than being obsessed with any particular language or tool. Sometimes the best language to use is the Delete button.
- Obsessed with documentation and automation - my memory sucks, so if it's not written down somewhere easy to find, it doesn't exist. Every team I've ever been on I've been a champion for documenting processes in our repos and writing scripts for any annoying tasks.

### üë©‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüëß Coworker

- Emoji lover ‚Äî been described as having ‚Äústrong emoji game‚Äù.
- Strength in empathy, encouragement, and building a positive team atmosphere. Unfortunately, that pairs with having trouble making tough decisions about people ‚Äî don‚Äôt put me in charge of firing anyone, they‚Äôll end up with a bonus instead.

### üìù Writer

Attempting to wrangle the mess of ideas in my head with words. Moderately succeeding. Lofty goal of [1 million words published](https://kevinquinn.fun/wc/) on big wide web.

### üöØ Hoarding Minimalist

Embraced minimalism, but I struggle to throw things away that are ‚Äúperfectly good‚Äù (spoiler: to most people they are already trash). 

### ü•£ Serial Creator

Keep trying to build things after listening to too many episodes of Indie Hackers. You‚Äôll find the full list on my [Projects](/projects/) page, but one of my more potent learning experiences around startups/product-building I cover in-depth in [Reflecting on my Failure to Build a One Dollar Company.](https://kevinquinn.fun/blog/reflecting-on-my-failure-to-build-a-one-dollar-company/)

### ü§π Professional Dabbler

I aim to be curious and open to new experiences, which leads me down a variety of [rabbit holes](https://facadeproject.com).
