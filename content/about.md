Backend software engineer by day at Large Corp 🏛, and [all sorts of stuff by night](https://facadeproject.com) since I can’t sit still.  I’ve attempted to build a number of different SaaS products before realizing creating content is just as, if not more, fun than writing code you have to maintain 🤓.  I’ve worn a lot of hats, from founder, developer, writer, podcaster, and more. Investigating a growing interest in writing, Developer & User Experience, No-code, entrepreneurship, and cyber security.

If you'd like to reach out for whatever reason, easiest place to reach me is through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maybekq) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/quinnkevinp).

### 🧑‍💻 [Product-minded](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer/) Backend Software Engineer

- Know enough to be dangerous across the stack, from Ansible to Python to React, but most effective working with non-GUI projects — CLIs, APIs, backend systems.
- I focus on building products with value, rather than being obsessed with any particular language or tool. Sometimes the best language to use is the Delete button.
- If you’re looking for a code monkey, we’ll both be disappointed 🙈.
- Exploring an interest in developer experience & UX

### 👩‍👩‍👧‍👧 Coworker

- Emoji lover — been described as having “strong emoji game”.
- Strength in empathy, encouragement, and building a positive team atmosphere. Unfortunately, that pairs with having trouble making tough decisions about people — don’t put me in charge of firing anyone, they’ll end up with a bonus instead.

## 📝 Writer

Attempting to wrangle the mess of ideas in my head with words. Moderately succeeding. Lofty goal of [1 million words published](https://kevinquinn.fun/wc/) on big wide web.

## 🚯 Hoarding Minimalist

Embraced minimalism, but I struggle to throw things away that are “perfectly good” (spoiler: to most people they are already trash). 

## 🥣 Serial Creator

Keep trying to build things after listening to too many episodes of Indie Hackers. You’ll find the full list on my Projects page, but one of my more potent learning experiences around startups/product-building I cover in-depth in [Reflecting on my Failure to Build a One Dollar Company.](https://kevinquinn.fun/blog/reflecting-on-my-failure-to-build-a-one-dollar-company/)

## 🤹 Professional Dabbler

I aim to be curious and open to new experiences, which leads me down a variety of rabbit holes.
