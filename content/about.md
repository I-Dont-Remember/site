Software engineer by day, all sorts of stuff by night. Investigating a growing interest in No-code, security, development best practices, and entrepreneurship. Usually building projects.

Why _"Bad Rememberer"_? I can't keep a million plates spinning in my head, so I rely on good documentation & notes to make progress on anything. It becomes really handy when collaborating with people, hard to find a person who hates having instructions documented.

If you'd like to reach out for whatever reason, easiest place to reach me is through Twitter or LinkedIn.
