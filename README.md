# Personal Site

original theme: [https://github.com/shenoybr/hugo-goa](https://github.com/shenoybr/hugo-goa)

Eventually want to connect to [forestry](https://forestry.io/docs/welcome/).

According to docs on [this theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-future-imperfect-slim/) we should have used git submodule for getting our theme and then altered things by creating a matching file in our site's directory rather than directly editing the other one, as now it's difficult to pull any changes from the original. That is true, but I don't think there seemed to be that much development work going on upstream PLUS odds are we migrate to a different one within a year.

Considering in the future moving my TIL items to `Snippets` like this, less pressure to make them useful https://leerob.io/snippets.
